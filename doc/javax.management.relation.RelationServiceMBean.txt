*javax.management.relation.RelationServiceMBean.purgeRelations()*

public void purgeRelations()
  throws |javax.management.relation.RelationServiceNotRegisteredException|
         
Purges the relations. 

Depending on the purgeFlag value, this method is either called automatically when a notification is received for the 
unregistration of an MBean referenced in a relation (if the flag is set to true), or not (if the flag is set to false). In that 
case it is up to the user to call it to maintain the consistency of the relations. To be kept in mind that if an MBean is 
unregistered and the purge not done immediately, if the ObjectName is reused and assigned to another MBean referenced in a 
relation, calling manually this purgeRelations() method will cause trouble, as will consider the ObjectName as corresponding to 
the unregistered MBean, not seeing the new one. 

The behavior depends on the cardinality of the role where the unregistered MBean is referenced: - if removing one MBean 
reference in the role makes its number of references less than the minimum degree, the relation has to be removed. - if the 
remaining number of references after removing the MBean reference is still in the cardinality range, keep the relation and 
update it calling its handleMBeanUnregistration() callback.
