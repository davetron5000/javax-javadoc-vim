*javax.management.relation.RoleUnresolvedList_Description*

A RoleUnresolvedList represents a list of RoleUnresolved objects, representing roles not retrieved from a relation due to a 
problem encountered when trying to access (read or write) the roles. 



*javax.management.relation.RoleUnresolvedList()*

public RoleUnresolvedList()

Constructs an empty RoleUnresolvedList. 


*javax.management.relation.RoleUnresolvedList(int)*

public RoleUnresolvedList(int initialCapacity)

Constructs an empty RoleUnresolvedList with the initial capacity specified. 

    initialCapacity - initial capacity 

*javax.management.relation.RoleUnresolvedList(List<RoleUnresolved>)*

public RoleUnresolvedList(java.util.List<javax.management.relation.RoleUnresolved> list)
  throws |java.lang.IllegalArgumentException|
         
Constructs aRoleUnresolvedListcontaining the elements of theListspecified, in the order in which they are returned by theList's 
iterator. TheRoleUnresolvedListinstance has an initial capacity of 110% of the size of theListspecified. 

    list - the {@code List} that defines the initial contents of the new {@code RoleUnresolvedList}. 

*javax.management.relation.RoleUnresolvedList.add(int,Object)*

public void add(
  int index,
  java.lang.Object element)





*javax.management.relation.RoleUnresolvedList.add(int,RoleUnresolved)*

public void add(
  int index,
  javax.management.relation.RoleUnresolved role)
  throws |java.lang.IllegalArgumentException|
         |java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException|
         
Inserts the unresolved role specified as an element at the position specified. Elements with an index greater than or equal to 
the current position are shifted up. 


    index - - The position in the list where the new RoleUnresolved object is to be inserted. 
    role - - The RoleUnresolved object to be inserted. 

*javax.management.relation.RoleUnresolvedList.add(Object)*

public boolean add(java.lang.Object o)





*javax.management.relation.RoleUnresolvedList.add(RoleUnresolved)*

public void add(javax.management.relation.RoleUnresolved role)
  throws |java.lang.IllegalArgumentException|
         
Adds the RoleUnresolved specified as the last element of the list. 


    role - - the unresolved role to be added. 

*javax.management.relation.RoleUnresolvedList.addAll(Collection<?>)*

public boolean addAll(java.util.Collection<?> c)





*javax.management.relation.RoleUnresolvedList.addAll(int,Collection<?>)*

public boolean addAll(
  int index,
  java.util.Collection<?> c)





*javax.management.relation.RoleUnresolvedList.addAll(int,RoleUnresolvedList)*

public boolean addAll(
  int index,
  javax.management.relation.RoleUnresolvedList roleList)
  throws |java.lang.IllegalArgumentException|
         |java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException|
         
Inserts all of the elements in the RoleUnresolvedList specified into this list, starting at the specified position, in the 
order in which they are returned by the Iterator of the RoleUnresolvedList specified. 


    index - - Position at which to insert the first element from the RoleUnresolvedList specified. 
    roleList - - Elements to be inserted into the list. 

    Returns: true if this list changed as a result of the call. 

*javax.management.relation.RoleUnresolvedList.addAll(RoleUnresolvedList)*

public boolean addAll(javax.management.relation.RoleUnresolvedList roleList)
  throws |java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException|
         
Appends all the elements in the RoleUnresolvedList specified to the end of the list, in the order in which they are returned by 
the Iterator of the RoleUnresolvedList specified. 


    roleList - - Elements to be inserted into the list (can be null). 

    Returns: true if this list changed as a result of the call. 

*javax.management.relation.RoleUnresolvedList.asList()*

public |java.util.List|<RoleUnresolved> asList()

Return a view of this list as aList. Changes to the returned value are reflected by changes to the 
originalRoleUnresolvedListand vice versa. 



    Returns: a {@code List} whose contents reflect the contents of this {@code RoleUnresolvedList}. 

If this method has ever been called on a given {@code RoleUnresolvedList} instance, a subsequent attempt to add an object to 
             that instance which is not a {@code RoleUnresolved} will fail with an {@code IllegalArgumentException}. For 
             compatibility reasons, a {@code RoleUnresolvedList} on which this method has never been called does allow objects 
             other than {@code RoleUnresolved}s to be added. 

*javax.management.relation.RoleUnresolvedList.set(int,Object)*

public |java.lang.Object| set(
  int index,
  java.lang.Object element)





*javax.management.relation.RoleUnresolvedList.set(int,RoleUnresolved)*

public void set(
  int index,
  javax.management.relation.RoleUnresolved role)
  throws |java.lang.IllegalArgumentException|
         |java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException|
         
Sets the element at the position specified to be the unresolved role specified. The previous element at that position is 
discarded. 


    index - - The position specified. 
    role - - The value to which the unresolved role element should be set.
