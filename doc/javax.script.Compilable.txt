*javax.script.Compilable_Methods*
|javax.script.Compilable.compile(Reader)|Compiles the script (source read from Reader) for  later execution.
|javax.script.Compilable.compile(String)|Compiles the script (source represented as a String) for  later execution.

*javax.script.Compilable_Description*

The optional interface implemented by ScriptEngines whose methods compile scripts to a form that can be executed repeatedly 
without recompilation. 



*javax.script.Compilable.compile(Reader)*

public |javax.script.CompiledScript| compile(java.io.Reader script)
  throws |javax.script.ScriptException|
         
Compiles the script (source read from Reader) for later execution. Functionality is identical to compile(String) other than the 
way in which the source is passed. 


    script - The reader from which the script source is obtained. 

    Returns: An implementation of CompiledScript to be executed later using one of its eval methods of CompiledScript. 

*javax.script.Compilable.compile(String)*

public |javax.script.CompiledScript| compile(java.lang.String script)
  throws |javax.script.ScriptException|
         
Compiles the script (source represented as a String) for later execution. 


    script - The source of the script, represented as a String. 

    Returns: An subclass of CompiledScript to be executed later using one of the eval methods of CompiledScript.
