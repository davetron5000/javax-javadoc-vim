*javax.script.CompiledScript_Description*

Extended by classes that store results of compilations. State might be stored in the form of Java classes, Java class files or 
scripting language opcodes. The script may be executed repeatedly without reparsing. 

Each CompiledScript is associated with a ScriptEngine -- A call to an eval method of the CompiledScript causes the execution of 
the script by the ScriptEngine. Changes in the state of the ScriptEngine caused by execution of tne CompiledScript may visible 
during subsequent executions of scripts by the engine. 



*javax.script.CompiledScript()*

public CompiledScript()




*javax.script.CompiledScript.eval()*

public |java.lang.Object| eval()
  throws |javax.script.ScriptException|
         
Executes the program stored in the CompiledScript object. The default ScriptContext of the associated ScriptEngine is used. The 
effect of calling this method is same as that of eval(getEngine().getContext()). 



    Returns: The return value from the script execution 

*javax.script.CompiledScript.eval(Bindings)*

public |java.lang.Object| eval(javax.script.Bindings bindings)
  throws |javax.script.ScriptException|
         
Executes the program stored in the CompiledScript object using the supplied Bindings of attributes as the ENGINE_SCOPE of the 
associated ScriptEngine during script execution. If bindings is null, then the effect of calling this method is same as that of 
eval(getEngine().getContext()). . The GLOBAL_SCOPE Bindings, Reader and Writer associated with the default ScriptContext of the 
associated ScriptEngine are used. 


    bindings - The bindings of attributes used for the ENGINE_SCOPE. 

    Returns: The return value from the script execution 

*javax.script.CompiledScript.eval(ScriptContext)*

public abstract |java.lang.Object| eval(javax.script.ScriptContext context)
  throws |javax.script.ScriptException|
         
Executes the program stored in this CompiledScript object. 


    context - A ScriptContext that is used in the same way as the ScriptContext passed to the eval methods of ScriptEngine. 

    Returns: The value returned by the script execution, if any. Should return null if no value is returned by the script execution. 

*javax.script.CompiledScript.getEngine()*

public abstract |javax.script.ScriptEngine| getEngine()

Returns the ScriptEngine wbose compile method created this CompiledScript. The CompiledScript will execute in this engine. 



    Returns: The ScriptEngine that created this CompiledScript
