*javax.sql.CommonDataSource_Description*

Interface that defines the methods which are common between DataSource, XADataSource and ConnectionPoolDataSource. 



*javax.sql.CommonDataSource.getLoginTimeout()*

public int getLoginTimeout()
  throws |java.sql.SQLException|
         
Gets the maximum time in seconds that this data source can wait while attempting to connect to a database. A value of zero 
means that the timeout is the default system timeout if there is one; otherwise, it means that there is no timeout. When a 
DataSource object is created, the login timeout is initially zero. 



    Returns: the data source login time limit 

*javax.sql.CommonDataSource.getLogWriter()*

public |java.io.PrintWriter| getLogWriter()
  throws |java.sql.SQLException|
         
Retrieves the log writer for this DataSource object. 

The log writer is a character output stream to which all logging and tracing messages for this data source will be printed. 
This includes messages printed by the methods of this object, messages printed by methods of other objects manufactured by this 
object, and so on. Messages printed to a data source specific log writer are not printed to the log writer associated with the 
java.sql.DriverManager class. When a DataSource object is created, the log writer is initially null; in other words, the 
default is for logging to be disabled. 



    Returns: the log writer for this data source or null if logging is disabled 

*javax.sql.CommonDataSource.setLoginTimeout(int)*

public void setLoginTimeout(int seconds)
  throws |java.sql.SQLException|
         
Sets the maximum time in seconds that this data source will wait while attempting to connect to a database. A value of zero 
specifies that the timeout is the default system timeout if there is one; otherwise, it specifies that there is no timeout. 
When a DataSource object is created, the login timeout is initially zero. 


    seconds - the data source login time limit 

*javax.sql.CommonDataSource.setLogWriter(PrintWriter)*

public void setLogWriter(java.io.PrintWriter out)
  throws |java.sql.SQLException|
         
Sets the log writer for this DataSource object to the given java.io.PrintWriter object. 

The log writer is a character output stream to which all logging and tracing messages for this data source will be printed. 
This includes messages printed by the methods of this object, messages printed by methods of other objects manufactured by this 
object, and so on. Messages printed to a data source- specific log writer are not printed to the log writer associated with the 
java.sql.DriverManager class. When a DataSource object is created the log writer is initially null; in other words, the default 
is for logging to be disabled. 


    out - the new log writer; to disable logging, set to null
