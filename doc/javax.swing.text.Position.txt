*javax.swing.text.Position_Description*

Represents a location within a document. It is intended to abstract away implementation details of the document and enable 
specification of positions within the document that are capable of tracking of change as the document is edited. 

APositionobject points at a location between two characters. As the surrounding content is altered, thePositionobject adjusts 
its offset automatically to reflect the changes. If content is inserted or removed before thePositionobject's location, then 
thePositionincrements or decrements its offset, respectively, so as to point to the same location. If a portion of the document 
is removed that contains aPosition's offset, then thePosition's offset becomes that of the beginning of the removed region. For 
example, if aPositionhas an offset of 5 and the region 2-10 is removed, then thePosition's offset becomes 2. Positionwith an 
offset of 0 is a special case. It never changes its offset while document content is altered.
